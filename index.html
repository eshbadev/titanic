       Titanic, launched on May 31, 1911, and set sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton on April 10, 1912, with 2,240 passengers and crew on board. On April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg, Titanic broke apart and sank to the bottom of the ocean, taking with it the lives of more than 1,500 passengers and crew
.
             The movie is about the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic. It stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. The two play characters who are of different social classes. They fall in love after meeting aboard the ship, but it was not good for a rich girl to fall in love with a poor boy in 1912.

         <p><b>what is sad about titanic?</b></p>
<p>More than 1,500 people died during the real-life sinking of the Titanic. While much of the movie details the joy and excitement of first love, "Titanic" becomes a disaster film in its latter half.</p>
